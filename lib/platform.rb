# platform.rb: naive platform detection for Ruby

#

# == Platform
#
# Platform is a simple module which parses the Ruby constant
# RUBY_PLATFORM and works out the OS, it's implementation,
# and the architecture it's running on.
#
# The motivation for writing this was coming across a case where
#
# +if RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /win/+
#
# didn't behave as expected (i.e. on powerpc-darwin-8.1.0)
#
# It is hoped that providing a library for parsing the platform
# means that we can cover all the cases and have something which
# works reliably 99% of the time.
#
# Please report any anomalies or new combinations to the author(s).
#
# == Use
#
# require "platform"
#
# defines
#
# Platform::OS (:unix,:win32,:vms,:os2)
# Platform::IMPL (:macosx,:linux,:mswin)
# Platform::ARCH (:powerpc,:x86,:alpha)
#
# if an unknown configuration is encountered any (or all) of
# these constant may have the value :unknown.
#
# To display the combination for your setup run
#
# ruby platform.rb
#
